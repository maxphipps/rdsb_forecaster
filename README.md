### Overview
This project contains a simple ridge regression model to predict the Shell (ticker: SHEL) share price based on its fundamentals.
The default config fits performs a fit to 10 years' historical data commencing 2001-02-01.

Specifically, the target variable is the daily Shell spot close price in US cents. 
No adjustment for dividends is applied to this price series.

The model considers a number of features
(asterick indicates features in use for default config):
* Financials:
  * Income and balance sheet data(*)
  * Margins
  * Production volumes(*)
* Spot prices
  * Natural gas commercial(*)
  * WTI crude(*)
  * US Gasoline all retail(*)
  
### Usage
The model can be ran by running the below at the command line:
```
python rdsb_forecaster.py
```

Following this command, the below outputs should then be displayed
showing the ridge regression coeffients and error alpha dependency:

The Shell close price prediction (US cents) should then be output:
